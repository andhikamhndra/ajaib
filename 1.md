# Explain how Object Oriented Programming works with a thorough understanding of the keyword this and the new keyword

OOP works as program organization that allows the coders to protect the key daya elements. OOP can have many objects. Each objects can be unique and can be identified by identity and state.

Lets say i have an object,  **Vehicle**.

we can assign that class with;

    class Vehicle {
      constructor() {
    
      }
    }

**Vehicle** can have multiple state, such as color, model, type, etc.

Within an instance method or a constructor, this is a reference to the current object — the **Vehicle** object whose method or constructor is being called.

    class Vehicle {
      constructor(color, brand, model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
      }
    }

after that, if we want to grab the Vehicle detail we can just declare it as;

    const Tesla = new Vehicle('Blue', 'Tesla', 'S');
