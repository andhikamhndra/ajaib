# Give an example of how you structure applications with design patterns using closure and modules

A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together, It can be passed around as a value. It can be executed on demand by any procedure or method that has that value.

For example, we have already created a Vehicle class before, by calling the class;

    const Tesla = new Vehicle('Blue', 'Tesla', 'S');
    
It can refer to variables from the context in which it was created (it is “closed” with respect to variable access).

The **module** pattern simply allows you to keep units of code cleanly separated and organized.

Lets say i have a bunch of routes.

    const routes = [
        ,
        {
            ...
        }
        {
            ...
        }
        ,
        {
            ...
        }
        ,
        {
            ...
        }
    ];
    
    export default routes;

I can use that route for the router by applying loop here;

    import routes from "./routes";
    <Router>
        {routes.map((route) => <Route key={route.title} {...route} />)}
    </Router>

By creating the routes separately, we have save time if we want to edit or add more routes to the app.
