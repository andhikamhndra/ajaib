# Imagine refactoring an ES5 application to use ES2015, how would you go about it?

Since ES6 came with lots of amazing features for devs, i would say refactoring ES5 to ES6 will be a challenge. What i would do in general are;

1. Use of let and const instead of var.
2. Change function to be an arrow function.
3. Use of Array spread (...) to combine arrays.
4. Use the template literals instead of using +
5. More us of promise for api calls.
6. Etc.

There's a load of features that can be useful.
