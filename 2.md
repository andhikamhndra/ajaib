# What is the new class syntax and how to create instance methods, class methods?

Classes are like templates to create the object, previously we come across Car classes that we created above.

Vehicle can have many methods or behaviour. Start, move, stop, etc.
We can implement that behavior into class methods.

    class Vehicle {
      constructor(color, brand, model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
      }
    
      startVehicle() {
          return "Vehicle starting";
      }
    }

if we want to access the method of starting the Vehicle, we can define the instance and access the methods.

    const Tesla = new Vehicle('Blue', 'Tesla', 'S');
    console.log(Tesla.startVehicle());
