# Give an example of how to implement inheritance in ES2015 using extends and super.

**Extend** is being use to indicate that a class is inherited from another class, and **super** being used to grab the method from parent class.

We already have the **Vehicle** class above.

    class Vehicle {
      constructor(color, brand, model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
      }
    
      startVehicle() {
          return "Vehicle starting";
      }
    }

we can create another instance for vehicle as the child class.

    class Car extends Vehicle {
      constructor (brand) {
        super(brand, 'car');
      }
 
      getName () {
        return 'It is a car: ' + super.getName();
      }
    }
